The app works on the output of accelerometer and gyro that is integrated in every phone. Initially, when we install the app, we need to update the emergency contact numbers. Later, whenever there is an emergency, one just needs to shake the phone. The shake sensors detect the movement of the phone and activate the following things - 
1. Reads GPS location of the user
2. Sends text messages to emergency contacts stating there is an emergency in a particular location.
3. Sends a post request to the server that the app is subscribed to
4. Rings a loud alarm/siren to scare the attacker and to attract public attention
5. Helps tracing the attacker by sending GPS locations continuously
